                <p>Life on the sea demands warm clothes and the properties of wool made it the perfect material for the fishermen on the boats. Furthermore sheep was one of the only animals able to survive in the windblown landscape surrounding the small village. Meaning the fishing families could make their own clothing for the rough weather and life on the open coast. Since the 1980 ́s it has also been a very popular destination for surfers from the North of Europe and now attracts thousands of surfers every year. Both cultures evolve around the sea and create a uniques mix of old and new aspects.</p>
